australismod
============

Firefox extension that modifies browsers with Australis in a few ways.

* reduced padding (including window borders and space above tab bar)
* reduced tab and tabbar height
* new slim title bar between tab bar and address bar
* maximize/restore by double clicking on tab
* Close Window option in tab context menu
* replaced tab bar's default toolbar context menu with Restore, Toolbars, Minimize, Maximize and Close Window options
* reduced size of newtab tiles

The reduced space above the tab bar might inconvenience moving a window.
The Drag-2-Move extension might reduce the inconvenience.
